    <h3>About Novusk:</h3>
    <br>

    <p style="margin-right: 35%">Novusk is a kernel inspired by <a href="https://www.linux.org/">Linux</a> written in
        Rust intended for OS and bare-metal app development, but can be used for many other things too. Novusk is
        opensource so it can also be used as a learning resource for people wanting to modernize OS development and use
        a new language, you can find New Kernel's fork of Novusk <a href="https://github.com/new-kernel/novusk">here</a>
        and the main repository can be found <a href="https://github.com/NathanMcMillan54/novusk">here</a>. As of right
        now Novusk is developing its fourth version and improving its third, has released several beta versions.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Here are all released major versions:</p>

    <h3>Updates</h3>
    <br>

    <h3 id="2022/4/23_1">Novusk v3 2022/4/23</h3>
    <p style="margin-right: 35%">Even though Novusk v3 just recently came out it's starting to look like it shouldn't
        be used anymore or needs almost a complete rewrite because of a few problems. Lots of Novusk's dependencies are
        unmaintained and don't work with the current version of Rust (1.60 - 1.62), another thing is linker errors
        caused by drivers getting mixed together. Fixing unmaintained dependencies can be done by implementing them
        manually and fixing linker errors could be done with a bit of reorganizing. Doing a rewrite is probably the best
        thing to do to fix this problem and prevent it from happening again, <a href="">This (#22)</a> is an issue to
        keep track of the problem</p>

    <h3 id="2022/1/12_2">Novusk v3 2022/1/12</h3>
    <p style="margin-right: 35%">Novusk v3 has been released! It is the biggest major version released so far, it
        improves many features and adds many more. This new version added architecture support for ARM (32 bit),
        RISCV32, and <a href="https://github.com/esp-rs/rust">Xtensa</a> (Xtensa is experimental), added drivers:
        graphics, basic networking, basic disk/sd reading, and firmware accessing (mailbox). System calls and user
        libraries like LibC have been greatly improved which makes Novusk much more accessible and easier to use.
        <a href="https://github.com/NathanMcMillan54/novusk/releases/tag/v3">This tag</a> has a list of all things that
        have been added.</p>
    <p style="margin-top: 1%; margin-right: 35%">Novusk v3 is being moved to
        <a href="https://github.com/NathanMcMillan54/novusk/tree/v3">this branch</a> for maintaining and future updates,
        most minor or really minor updates should add features from
        <a href="https://github.com/NathanMcMillan54/novusk/issues/14">this issue</a> which is a TODO list for Novusk
        v3, and the master branch will be used for developing future versions and use parts of the "v3" branch if
        needed.</p>
